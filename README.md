## Description

My very own website portfolio; Allowing interested parties to gaze upon my HTML, CSS, JS, React, and Node.js skill, then navigate to my completed works to properly demonstrate my front-end web development capability. Made using the criteria from Module 20 of my edX Web Development bootcamp. I made it as compact as possible within my tight time limit I had.

The application was built using HTML, JS, CSS, HTML, React, and Node.js, and was deployed using Github Pages.
